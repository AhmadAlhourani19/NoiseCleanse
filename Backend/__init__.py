NoiseCleanse: A modular audio processing library for impulse response extraction,
offline and live audio deconvolution.

This package includes tools to:
- Generate and analyze sine sweeps
- Record room responses
- Extract and preprocess impulse responses
- Perform offline deconvolution of speech signals
- Run real-time FIR-based deconvolution

UI is handled externally. This module exposes only core processing logic.
